# **Domain of Interest**

## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- We are interested in how poverty and income inequality evolves over time

### Other examples of Data-Driven Projects related to Domain:
- [Example1](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-data-science-to-study-economic-inequality-in-the-united-states-1101e9350c3d) -  In this data driven project, data is used to study economic inequality in the U.S and how it may pay pose challenges to certain populations.
- [Example2](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty) - This project uses data to show an overview of poverty globally and also provides visualization of things such as the poverty gap, and the amount of money it would take to fill in that gap.
- [Example3](https://sauravpahadia.shinyapps.io/ae5_final_project/) - This project used data to discover if there was any association between youth poverty and youth smoking.

### Data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain:
1. How has poverty changed over the course of 10 years?
2. How has race played a factor in this?
3. How has the coronavirus increased the gap between the poor and the rich?

# Finding Data

#### How was the data collected or generated?
The data was collected by the U.S. Census Bureau via phone and in-person interviews in the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC). A sample of about 60,000 households were surveyed for four consecutive months, left out for eight months, then surveyed for another four months [(Resource)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentpopulationsurvey.asp#:~:text=How%20The%20Survey%20Works,sample%20of%20about%2060%2C000%20households.).
#### Information about the data set
5451 observations, 16 features
#### What questions can be answered using the data in this dataset?
* How has poverty changed over the course of 10 years?
* How has race played a factor in this?

## Data Set 2: SAIPE School District Estimates for 2019
[Link to Data Set](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/datasets/2019/2019-school-districts/ussd19.xls)
#### How was the data collected or generated?
The data was generated by the U.S. Census Bureau by using models to estimate annual income and poverty for school districts.
SAIPE calculates poverty rate based on school districtsâ€™ tax returns and multiplies the derived poverty rate by the total school-aged children population collected from the U.S. census. The result is an estimate of the poverty population within a school district [(Resource)](https://www.census.gov/library/video/saipe-pov-est-sch-dis.html).
#### Information about the data set
13185 observations, 7 features
#### What questions can be answered using the data in this dataset?
* How has poverty changed over the course of 10 years?
* How has race played a factor in this?
